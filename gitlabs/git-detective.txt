cd into git and use the command "grep git log --grep="git merge-tree" This just allows you to see all the files that have stuff. To see all the commits, go to
emacs and look at all the commits. This one actually talks about the issue and this is the output. It looks like Derrick Stole is the one who created the changes and described the issue.

    merge-tree: load default git config

    The 'git merge-tree' command handles creating root trees for merges
    without using the worktree. This is a critical operation in many Git
    hosts, as they typically store bare repositories.

    This builtin does not load the default Git config, which can have
    several important ramifications.

    In particular, one config that is loaded by default is
    core.useReplaceRefs. This is typically disabled in Git hosts due to
    the ability to spoof commits in strange ways.

    Since this config is not loaded specifically during merge-tree, users
    were previously able to use refs/replace/ references to make pull

    Since this config is not loaded specifically during merge-tree, users
    were previously able to use refs/replace/ references to make pull
    requests that looked valid but introduced malicious content. The
    resulting merge commit would have the correct commit history, but the
    malicious content would exist in the root tree of the merge.

    The fix is simple: load the default Git config in cmd_merge_tree().
    This may also fix other behaviors that are effected by reading default
    config. The only possible downside is a little extra computation time
    spent reading config. The config parsing is placed after basic argument
    parsing so it does not slow down usage errors.
